                <p>
                    Our users are frustrated when attempting to split the bill between drinkers and nondrinkers. Drinkers may take advantage of bill splitting to buy multiple drinks causing a split of the bill to be unfair. Our solution would provide users with an easy way to split the bill without taking drinks into consideration.

                <p>
                    To begin our problem solving process, we created an affinity diagram that consists of different categories related to splitting the bill with drinkers, such as the type of establishment, how the drinks were bought, the types of drinkers there were, and common problems when splitting bills. This will grant us better understanding of our problem, leading to a better solution.
